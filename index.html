	'were incredible. When I got in I took a walk along the cliffs on a really windy but sunny day. They provided some beautiful views of ' +

	'Britain to mainland Europe, and had a very influential role in sending rescue missions to the nearby Dunkirk in WWII, rescuing more ' +
	'than 350,000 soldiers when the Nazis were closing in. There were some pretty spectacular tunnels, originally built back in the ' +
	'eighteenth century in response to a potential attack from Napoleon Bonaparte, but got the most use during WWII. Aside from the large war ' +
	'history the castle grounds had, the medieval side of the castle had a ton of different underground passages and hidden entrances. The ' +
